                        <p>You wish to use CPSâs services to facilitate marketing and sale of your art and to arrange for manufacture and delivery or pick up of a physical product ("your product") once an order has been made through www.canvasprintstudio.com.au ("the website"). CPS will provide these services on the terms set out in this Services Agreement.</p><br>

                        <p class="title title2">1. Services</p>
                        
                        <p>1.1 CPS, acting as independent contractor under your instructions will market to and obtain orders from customers for the purchase of your products over the website and on instruction from you, CPS. will arrange for third parties if need be to fulfil those orders by facilitating payment for and manufacture of your products (âServicesâ). CPS will then arrange for the delivery or pickup from designated location of your products as per the customerâs instructions.</p><br>
                        
                        <p>1.2 CPS will provide the Services pursuant to this agreement until termination in accordance with its terms.</p><br>
                        
                        <p>1.3 You agree that CPS is free to act in any capacity for any other person interested in promoting, marketing and obtaining orders from members of the public for the purchase of their arts over the website, including any art that is the same as, or similar to, your products.</p>
                        
                        <p class="title title2">2. License and standing instructions</p>
                        
                        <p>2.1 You grant CPS a non-exclusive royalty free license to use your intellectual property relating to your products for the purpose of enabling us to carry out the Services.</p><br>
                        
                        <p>2.2 You hereby instruct CPS. to facilitate payment, manufacture and shipping in respect of the orders for your product(s) via the website and CPS. will facilitate such payment, manufacturing and shipping in accordance with reasonable business practices unless you otherwise instruct prior to the placement of that order by a customer.</p>
                        
                        <p class="title title2">3. Sale of your products</p>
                        
                        <p>3.1 The retail price charged to customers who purchase your product is made up of the manufacturing fee and CPSâs fee for hosting the marketplace and facilitating the transaction (the manufacturing fee and CPS fee are referred to collectively, and inclusive of tax, as the âbase amountâ), your creator margin (âyour marginâ), and any relevant tax (such as Sales Tax, GST, VAT, etc). </p><br>
                        
                        <p>Shipping charges will also be added. When making each individual work available for sale you are able to select any percentage markup you wish, greater than or equal to 0, above the base amount but below the automated upper limit set by CPS (subject to change from time to time). The percentage markup selected by you on the website for each of your products is used to calculate the dollar value of your margin for each sale.</p><br>
                        
                        <p>3.2 You may change the percentage markup on top of the base amount at any time by changing your selection on the website. We may change the base amount at any time without specific notice to you and this will affect the dollar value of your margin, which is calculated as a percentage of the base amount (e.g. if we increase our base amount, your margin will also increase). The retail price will not change on an individual sale after a customer has submitted an order to the website.</p><br>
                        
                        <p>3.3 CPS will send you an email to the email address you registered in your account to notify you when an order has been placed for your products.</p><br>
                        
                        <p>3.4 You agree that CPS makes no representation that it will be able to procure an order for your products, whether at the retail price or at all, nor that you will obtain any benefit by entering into this Services Agreement.
                        </p>

                        <p>4.1 You authorize CPS to collect, hold and distribute the retail price and shipping charges (âsale proceedsâ) from customers on the terms set out in this clause 4.</p><br>
                        
                        <p>4.2 You authorize CPS to deduct the base amount and the shipping charges from the sales proceeds for your products before distributing your margin, and tax where relevant to you.</p><br>
                        
                        <p>4.3 We will either initiate a PayPal deposit or direct bank deposit before the 15th day of the month for sales made in the previous month depending on your choice.</p><br>
                        
                        <p>4.4 If your elected payment method is by direct bank transfer or PayPal transfer and your earnings for the month in the applicable currency are less than 20 Australian Dollars then CPS reserves the right to roll that amount over to the following month and continue to roll it over until you have earned at least the above mentioned amount.</p><br>
                        
                        <p>4.5 Despite clauses 4.4 and 4.5, you may request payment at any time for the full amount in your account and a AUS$10 administration fee will apply. CPS will pay this amount to you within 7 days of your request.</p> <br>
                        
                        <p>4.6 It is your responsibility to ensure CPS has current bank account or Paypal details. CPS will not be liable for any loss suffered by you if you provide us with incorrect details in relation to the payment method. If we are unable to pay you because you have given us incorrect details or your details are out of date, we will hold your margin for up to 12 months from the payment date. If you have not notified CPS of any amendment to the payment method details in that time, you authorize us to donate your margin proceeds to a charity of our choice.</p>
                        
                        <p class="title title2">5. Taxation responsibility</p>
                        
                        <p>5.1 Each party is responsible for their own taxes associated with each transaction and will account for any taxes imposed by governments or governing authorities, and related accounting or audit requirements arising out of, as a result of, incidental to, or in connection with obligations under this Services Agreement.

We will collect that amount on your behalf and distribute it to you with your margin using the payment method you have selected on the website.</p><br>
                        
                        <p>5.3 If you have an Australian Business Number (ABN) you may submit your ABN to the website where requested. If you do not have an ABN, or if you elect not to submit your ABN to the website, you will be required to provide more information about the circumstances under which you are offering your products for sale on the website, including whether any of the Australian Taxation Office (ATO) exemptions apply to you.</p><br>

                        <p>5.5 For the avoidance of doubt, all tax-related reporting responsibilities by you to relevant tax authorities are entirely your responsibility.</p>
                        
                        <p class="title title2">6. Indemnity</p>
                        
                        <p>6.1 You hereby indemnify and will keep CPS indemnified from and against all claims, debts, accounts, expenses, costs, liens, actions and proceedings of any nature whatsoever, whether known or unknown by any person, arising from, incidental to, or by virtue of, the appointment, or any breach or non performance of your obligations under this Services Agreement or arising out of your wilful act, neglect or default in the performance of such obligations.</p><br>
                        
                        <p>6.2 This clause 6 will survive the termination of this Services Agreement.</p>
                        
                        <p class="title title2">7. Limitation of liability</p>
