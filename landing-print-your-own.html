                        <p>What is Canvas Print Studio?<br>
                        Canvas Print Studio is a one stop shop for canvas printing and framing. We are 100% Australian made and owned and we pride ourselves on producing superior quality prints that are made to last a lifetime.
                        </p><br>
                        <p>Why buy from us?<br>
                        We only print to canvas, and we take pride in doing this exceptionally well. At Canvas Print Studio you can print images confidently, knowing you have an expert who will review your files and guarantee that you receive a canvas print you will be excited to hang on your wall.
                        </p><br>
                        <p>We are not a canvas factory, nor do we produce hundreds of genetic canvas prints and have them shipped to Australia. We do things the old fashioned way, with attention to detail and care. We make everything by hand in our Melbourne print studio and source all materials ethically and sustainably within Australia.
                        </p><br>
                        <p>Why do our prints cost more than Kmart, Officeworks and the Canvas Factory?<br>
                        Our services cater to anyone looking for a premium product that is made ethically within Australia using sustainably sourced materials. We have a passion for producing beautiful quality prints and our experienced team of photographers and artists will print, stretch and frame your canvas on site in our Melbourne print studio.  
                        </p><br>
                        <p>At no additional cost, we can edit, retouch and digitally enhance your image to ensure your file meets the premium standard that you’d expect. We offer a selection of standard sizes in photo, square and panoramic dimensions and also make custom sizes.</p>
                        <p class="title title2">PRODUCT INFORMATION</p>
                        <p>What type of canvas do you print on?<br>
                        We use Cason 380gsm poly-cotton matte canvas. This is a premium, archival canvas that stretches without cracking and is designed to remain taut over time. 
                        </p><br>
                        <p>What type of ink is used? <br>
                        We print with Canon and only use genuine Canon inks. Our colour profiles are customised to ensure colour accuracy when printing.
                        </p><br>
                        <p>Are prints UV protected and what does the finish look like?<br>
                        Each canvas is coated with Aquathane-UV liquid laminate to ensure prints are fade-resistant, durable and easy to clean. We use a matte / satin blend to give your print a solid protection without being flat and dull (matte) or overly shiny and reflective (glossy). 
                        </p><br>
                        <p>After many years of experience, we have been able to achieve the perfect blend to make your canvas print stand out from the rest.
                        </p><br>
                        <p>Is it essential to spray prints with a protective coating? <br>
                        Yes. this is an essential part of the process. Unless you are an artist and have plans to coat your canvas differently, this is a vital process to protect the canvas.
                        </p><br>
                        <p>What type of wood is used for the stretcher bars?<br>
                        All stretcher bars are kiln-dried and made from sustainable Australian regrowth timber. We custom make all frames in our print studio using stretcher bars that are specifically designed for inkjet canvas printing.
                        </p><br>
                        <p>What type of timber is used for the frames?<br>
                        We offer Victorian Ash timber floating frames in slim, medium and wide depths. Our range includes raw timber, white and black stain. Raw timber frames are coated with a beeswax finish and we use Porter’s original paints to hand paint our frames. We also offer a darker Blackwood timber on request.
                        </p><br>
                        <p>How do you finish the edges of the canvas?<br>
                        Our prefered method for the edges is a <a href="">pixel stretch</a>. In most cases, we find this to be the best option for covering the sides of your print. This avoids part of your mage being wrapped and lost around the sides. If you prefer a mirrored edge, solid colour or plain white, please let us know when ordering. </p><br>
                        <p>If you would like your image to wrap around this sides, please allow 35mm for prints A2 size or smaller. All prints larger than A2 size please allow 38mm for each edge. For example: 38mm top + 38mm bottom + 38mm left + 38mm right.</p><br>
                        <p>How do you manage colour when printing?<br>
                        We regularly collaborate our computer screen and have colour profiles specifically made for our printers. These colour management measures ensure we print true to the original subject and that we are able to make any necessary image adjustments prior to printing. 
                        </p><br>
                        <p>How is the artwork packaged?<br>
                        To protect the edges of your print we use a clear cling wrap and then neatly wrap in kraft paper. All larger canvas prints are fitted with cardboard corners for extra corner protection. We also offer free gift wrapping on any size print and place inside a protective cardboard box for delivery.
                        </p>

                        <p>What resolution do I need for my print?<br>
                        There are so many variables, so we can’t give you a clear answer to this question. We welcome you to send your images to us for an obligation-free quality review. We will let you know the largest size we can print your image and offer you a range of sizes and prices to choose from.
                        </p><br>
                        <p>What are the benefits for printing on canvas?<br>
                        Printing on canvas has many advantages for image resolution, especially if you are looking for a large size print. Canvas offers the ability to create sharper prints from images much lower in resolution than paper would produce. We also have image blow up software that enables you to enlarge your images, so you can get your desired size.
                        </p><br>
                        <p>What sizes can I order? <br>
                        Our maximum size is 1.36metres x 2.9metres. We custom make our frames, so you can choose any size within the above range.
                        </p><br>
                        <p>When do I pay and what payment methods do you accept?<br>
                        If you are ordering artwork from our gallery or printing a standard size, you can pay using credit card online. We use Braintree for secure online transactions. For custom orders, we email you an invoice to pay via EFT (bank transfer) or credit card. We also accept payment on pickup or via Paypal.
                        </p><br>

                        <p>What happens to my files after printing?<br>
                        We store images for up to six months on our private and secure network. We respect that these images are your private property and we do not share or print images without your permission.
                        </p><br>
                        <p>What is your stance on sustainability?<br>
                        In a world where many products available to us are not designed to last, we take the quality over quantity approach. Making products off shore from cheaper and unsustainable materials, is not our game. 
                        </p><br>
                        <p>We believe that buying and manufacturing locally is one of the fundamental ways to limit our impact on the environment. When you purchase from us, you can be 100% confident that your product has been made in Australia, and done with consideration for the planet.</p><br>
                        <p>Sustainable business practice doesn’t end with manufacturing, it includes taking responsibility for the entire lifespan of your product. For this reason, we make our products to last so you’ll be enjoying your purchase for decades to come.

                        <p>Where do printer cartridges end up?<br>
                        We work alongside <a href="http://www.closetheloop.com.au/">Close the Loop</a> to recycle all printer cartridges and utilise any excess ink. Cartridges are upcycled and made into park seating and stationery products such as rulers and the ink is used for ball point pens.
                        </p><br>
                        <p>Where does manufacturing waste end up?<br>
                        Running any business usually means producing more waste than your average person. With this in mind, we’ve set out to find solutions and ways to eliminate our manufacturing waste and environmental footprint.

                        Personally Identifiable Information from California consumers to post a conspicuous privacy

                        <p>When it comes to the collection of personal information from children under the age of 13 years
                        old, the Children&#39;s Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA) puts parents in control. The Federal
                        Trade Commission, United States&#39; consumer protection agency, enforces the COPPA Rule,
                        which spells out what operators of websites and online services must do to protect children&#39;s
                        privacy and safety online.

                        <p>The Fair Information Practices Principles form the backbone of privacy law in the United States
                        and the concepts they include have played a significant role in the development of data
                        protection laws around the globe. Understanding the Fair Information Practice Principles and
                        how they should be implemented is critical to comply with the various privacy laws that protect
                        personal information.
                        </p><br>
                        
                        <p>In order to be in line with Fair Information Practices we will take the following responsive action,
                        should a data breach occur:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>We will notify you via email</li>
                            <li>Other</li>

                        <p>We also agree to the Individual Redress Principle which requires that individuals have the right
                        to legally pursue enforceable rights against data collectors and processors who fail to adhere to
                        the law. This principle requires not only that individuals have enforceable rights against data
                        users, but also that individuals have recourse to courts or government agencies to investigate
                        and/or prosecute non-compliance by data processors.</p>
